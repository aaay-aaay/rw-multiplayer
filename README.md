# rw-multiplayer
This is my online multiplayer mod for Rain World. It uses the mod loader Partiality, and the hooks it provides with MonoMod.RuntimeDetour, to make any existing local multiplayer mod online. It is probably a complete buggy confusing mess but sometimes it works except for the fact that it doesn't work at all. Contributions are fine, but good luck doing that.
# But...
There are existing ways of making a local multiplayer mod online, like Parsec. But that doesn't let you have one screen for each player and it's not as ~~hell~~ fun for the programmer!
# Goals
* Don't use way too much internet
* Don't go crazy and send everything out of sync
* If something does go wrong make sure both sides know what's going on by the beginning of the next cycle and nothing breaks too badly while they disagree
* Compatability with Jolly Coop, and in theory any local multiplayer mod
# Installation
It's a normal partiality mod, and it won't work very well without a local coop mod too. If you get that far ask me (pastebin.com/q3BTYZc9) in #modding-support in the rain world server (http://discord.gg/rainworld) about how to actually use it.
# Testing
By running the RainWorld.exe directly you can run two rain worlds on the same computer. Then have one host and the other connect to 127.0.0.1, both with the multiplayer mod, jolly coop (unless you are specifically testing its compatability with other local multiplayer mods), and configmachine (if the multiplayer mod you are using requires it, jolly coop does). Also maybe talk to me (pastebin.com/q3BTYZc9) in #modding-support in the rain world server (http://discord.gg/rainworld).
# Contributing
Use whatever is the right thing for contributing. I don't know. :P
Somebody might want to edit this to be... better...
